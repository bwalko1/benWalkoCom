            <h2>Who is Ben Walko?</h2>
            <p>Hi! I am a Software Engineer that has a passion for working on enterprise level applications. I work for
                a company called MRI Software. My hobbies include video games and Rubik's cubes. I also attained the
                rank of Eagle Scout in 2012 when I was 16 years old. </p>

            <h2>Video games and Rubik's Cubes?</h2>
            <p>I have played many different video games, but some of the main ones include League of Legends, Minecraft,
                and Warframe. I have been playing them for as long as I can remember. I was always on the computer or
                gaming console as a child and I have never looked back since then.</p>
            <p>Rubik's Cubes always fascinated me and I always admired people who could solve them, so I decided to get
                into them myself. Several years later my collection has grown to many different sizes, shapes and colors
                of unique Rubik's Cubes.</p>
